# SimpleSQL

## Features
- Another super simple standalone Mono/.NET based SQL library!

- Just pass in your SQLConnection (MSSQL, MySQL, Postgres, Oracle...), your SQL statement, and an object or list of params!

- ORM in-and-out for individual or lists of objects!

- It generates and compiles code on the fly,  to read and write to all your POCO classes with data as quickly as if you hand-typed ADO.NET!
